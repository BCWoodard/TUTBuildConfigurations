The Challenge
======================
Developers often work in multiple environments at the same time or need to use different variables (URLs, Analytics codes, etc.) for the development, staging and production environments. Many iOS developers use a "constants" file to define the different variables and then manually update their code to switch out these variables prior to distribution based on the configuration they are building. While this works for smaller projects with a limited number of variables, the opportunity to overlook a change or variable is always there - not to mention trying to remember which variables need to be changed and when. This solution seeks to resolve this manual process by leveraging the ability to customize configurations in Xcode.
